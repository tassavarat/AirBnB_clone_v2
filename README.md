### More Info
![info0](https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/concepts/74/hbnb_step2.png)

### Supported classes:
* BaseModel
* User
* State
* City
* Amenity
* Place
* Review

### Commands:
* create - create an object
* show - show an object (based on id)
* destroy - destroy an object
* all - show all objects, of one type or all types
* quit/EOF - quit the console
* help - see descriptions of commands

To start, navigate to the project folder and enter `./console.py` in the shell.

#### Create
`create <class name>`
Ex:
`create BaseModel`

#### Show
`show <class name> <object id>`
Ex:
`show User my_id`

#### Destroy
`destroy <class name> <object id>`
Ex:
`destroy Place my_place_id`

#### All
`all` or `all <class name>`
Ex:
`all` or `all State`

#### Quit
`quit` or `EOF`

#### Help
`help` or `help <command>`
Ex:
`help` or `help quit`

Additionally, the console supports `<class name>.<command>(<parameters>)` syntax.
Ex:
`City.show(my_city_id)`

### 0. Fork me if you can!
In the industry, you will work on an existing codebase 90% of the time. Your first thoughts upon looking at it might include:

* “Who did this code?”
* “How it works?”
* “Where are unittests?”
* “Where is this?”
* “Why did they do that like this?”
* “I don’t understand anything.”
* “… I will refactor everything…”
But the worst thing you could possibly do is to redo everything. Please don’t do that! Note: the existing codebase might be perfect, or it might have errors. Don’t always trust the existing codebase!

For this project you will fork this codebase:

* update the repository name to AirBnB_clone_v2
* update the README.md with your information but don’t delete the initial authors
If you are the owner of this repository, please create a new repository named AirBnB_clone_v2 with the same content of AirBnB_clone

### 1 Bug free!
Do you remember the unittest module?

This codebase contains many test cases. Some are missing, but the ones included cover the basic functionality of the program.

```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ python3 -m unittest discover tests 2>&1 /dev/null | tail -n 1
OK
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ 
```
All your unittests must pass without any errors at anytime in this project, with each storage engine!. Same for PEP8!

```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ HBNB_ENV=test HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_test HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_test_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_test_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db python3 -m unittest discover tests 2>&1 /dev/null | tail -n 1
OK
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ 
```
Some tests won’t be relevant for some type of storage, please skip them by using the skipIf feature of the Unittest module - 26.3.6. Skipping tests and expected failures. Of course, the number of tests must be higher than the current number of tests, so if you decide to skip a test, you should write a new test!

How to test with MySQL?
First, you create a specific database for it (next tasks). After, you have to remember what the purpose of an unittest?

“Assert a current state (objects/data/database), do an action, and validate this action changed (or not) the state of your objects/data/database”

For example, “you want to validate that the create State name="California" command in the console will add a new record in your table states in your database”, here steps for your unittest:

get the number of current records in the table states (my using a MySQLdb for example - but not SQLAlchemy (remember, you want to test if it works, so it’s better to isolate from the system))
execute the console command
get (again) the number of current records in the table states (same method, with MySQLdb)
if the difference is +1 => test passed

### 2. Console improvements
Update the def do_create(self, arg): function of your command interpreter (console.py) to allow for object creation with given parameters:

* Command syntax: create <Class name> <param 1> <param 2> <param 3>...
* Param syntax: <key name>=<value>
* Value syntax:
	* String: "<value>" => starts with a double quote
		* any double quote inside the value must be escaped with a backslash \
		* all underscores _ must be replace by spaces . Example: You want to set the string My little house to the attribute name, your command line must be name="My_little_house"
	* Float: <unit>.<decimal> => contains a dot .
	* Integer: <number> => default case
* If any parameter doesn’t fit with these requirements or can’t be recognized correctly by your program, it must be skipped
Don’t forget to add tests for this new feature!

Also, this new feature will be tested here only with FileStorage engine.

### 3. MySQL setup development 
Write a script that prepares a MySQL server for the project:

* A database hbnb_dev_db
* A new user hbnb_dev (in localhost)
* The password of hbnb_dev should be set to hbnb_dev_pwd
* hbnb_dev should have all privileges on the database hbnb_dev_db (and only this database)
* hbnb_dev should have SELECT privilege on the database performance_schema (and only this database)
* If the database hbnb_dev_db or the user hbnb_dev already exists, your script should not fail

```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ cat setup_mysql_dev.sql | mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -p
Enter password: 
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ echo "SHOW DATABASES;" | mysql -uhbnb_dev -p | grep hbnb_dev_db
Enter password: 
hbnb_dev_db
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ echo "SHOW GRANTS FOR 'hbnb_dev'@'localhost';" | mysql -uroot -p
Enter password: 
Grants for hbnb_dev@localhost
GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'hbnb_dev'@'localhost'
GRANT SELECT ON `performance_schema`.* TO 'hbnb_dev'@'localhost'
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `hbnb_dev_db`.* TO 'hbnb_dev'@'localhost'
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ 
```

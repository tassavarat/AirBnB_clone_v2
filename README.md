# HBNB

This is the console /command interpreter for the Holberton Airbnb clone project. The console can be used to store objects in and retrieve objects from a JSON.

### Learning Objectives
* What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
* What is *args and how to use it
* What is **kwargs and how to use it
* How to handle named arguments in a function
* How to create a MySQL database
* How to create a MySQL user and grant it privileges
* What ORM means
* How to map a Python Class to a MySQL table
* How to handle 2 different storage engines with the same codebase
* How to use environment variables

### Requirements
## Python Scripts
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
* All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')

## Python Unit Tests
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your test files should be inside a folder tests
* You have to use the unittest module
* All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
* All your test files and folders should start by test_
* Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
* You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
* All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you donâ€™t miss any edge cases

### Supported classes:
* BaseModel
* User
* State
* City
* Amenity
* Place
* Review

### Commands:
* create - create an object
* show - show an object (based on id)
* destroy - destroy an object
* all - show all objects, of one type or all types
* quit/EOF - quit the console
* help - see descriptions of commands

To start, navigate to the project folder and enter `./console.py` in the shell.

#### Create
`create <class name>`
Ex:
`create BaseModel`

#### Show
`show <class name> <object id>`
Ex:
`show User my_id`

#### Destroy
`destroy <class name> <object id>`
Ex:
`destroy Place my_place_id`

#### All
`all` or `all <class name>`
Ex:
`all` or `all State`

#### Quit
`quit` or `EOF`

#### Help
`help` or `help <command>`
Ex:
`help` or `help quit`

Additionally, the console supports `<class name>.<command>(<parameters>)` syntax.
Ex:
`City.show(my_city_id)`
